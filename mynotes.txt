The sigrock software consists of the following components:

Libsigrok: a shared library written in C, which contains the general infrastructure for handling logic analyzer data in a streaming fashion. It also contains the individual hardware drivers, which add support for various logic analyzers.

Libsigrokdecode: a shared library written in C, which contains the protocol decoder infrastructure and the protocol decoders themselves, which are written in Python.

Sigrokcli: a command-line front end, which uses both libsigrok and libsigrokdecode. It can acquire samples from logic analyzers and output them in various formats into files or to stdout and/or run protocol decoders on the acquired data.

Sigrokqt: a Qt-based GUI for sigrok, using both libsigrok and libsigrokdecode. This is intended to be a cross-platform GUI (it runs fine and looks native on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X) supporting data acquisition and protocol decoding.
