with filter program in the same directory, use "./filter"
sudo sigrok-cli --driver saleae-logic16:conn=21a9.1001 --time 1s --config samplerate=1m -O binary | tee raw_unflipped | ./filter > filtered4.txt

since filter is added to bin folder, could be called with "filter" as well
sudo sigrok-cli --driver saleae-logic16:conn=21a9.1001 --time 1s --config samplerate=1m -O binary | tee raw_unflipped | filter > filtered4.txt

compress and save all files
sudo sigrok-cli --driver saleae-logic16:conn=21a9.1001 --time 1s --config samplerate=1m -O binary | tee raw_unflipped | filter | tee filtered4.txt | gzip -c>mydata.gz

remember gzip consumes the original file, that's why tee is needed

compress and save only the compressed
sudo sigrok-cli --driver saleae-logic16:conn=21a9.1001 --time 1s --config samplerate=1m -O binary | filter | gzip -c > mydata.gz

to run continuously change "--time 1s" to "--continuous"
compress and save only the compressed
sudo sigrok-cli --driver saleae-logic16:conn=21a9.1001 --continuous --config samplerate=1m -O binary | filter | gzip -c > mydata.gz

to add log level
sudo sigrok-cli --driver saleae-logic16:conn=21a9.1001 --continuous -l 1 --config samplerate=1m -O binary | filter | gzip -c > mydata.gz

to uncompress
zcat mydata.gz > filename
